## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Presentation API
1. **Browser Support**: Only Chrome/Edge fully support it
2. **HTTPS Required**: Won't work on http:// in production (localhost OK)
3. **Same Network**: Device and TV must be on same WiFi
4. **No Audio**: Web Presentation API doesn't cast audio
5. **One Connection**: Can only cast to one TV per browser tab

### Mobile Responsive
1. **Very Old Phones**: May struggle with 8-game layout
2. **Landscape on Small Phones**: Cramped, use portrait instead
3. **iOS Safari**: Some touch interactions may differ from Android
