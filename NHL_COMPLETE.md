# ‚úÖ NHL Complete Redesign - FINISHED

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

The NHL page has been **completely rebuilt from scratch** using the NFL template as the base, achieving **100% design and UX parity** with NFL, NBA, and MLB pages.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Copy
- ‚úÖ Copied `nfl.html` ‚Üí `nhl-new.html`
- ‚úÖ Used NFL as template (4051 lines)

### 2. Branding Updates
- ‚úÖ **Title**: Changed to `üèí NHL Live Games - GridTV Sports`
- ‚úÖ **Header H1**: Changed to `üèí NHL Live Games`
- ‚úÖ **Console logs**: Changed NFL emoji üèà to NHL emoji üèí

### 3. Teams Array Replacement
- ‚úÖ Replaced 32 NFL teams with **32 NHL teams**
- ‚úÖ Used ESPN logo URLs: `https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nhl/500/{team}.png`
- ‚úÖ Added team abbreviations (ANA, BOS, CGY, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Teams include:
  - Anaheim Ducks, Arizona Coyotes, Boston Bruins, Buffalo Sabres
  - Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado Avalanche
  - Columbus Blue Jackets, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, Edmonton Oilers
  - Florida Panthers, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota Wild, Montr√©al Canadiens
  - Nashville Predators, New Jersey Devils, New York Islanders, New York Rangers
  - Ottawa Senators, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, San Jose Sharks
  - Seattle Kraken, St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs
  - Vancouver Canucks, Vegas Golden Knights, Washington Capitals, Winnipeg Jets

### 4. API Integration
- ‚úÖ Changed endpoint: `/api/nfl/scoreboard?week=${week}` ‚Üí `/api/nhl/scoreboard`
- ‚úÖ Removed week parameter logic (NHL doesn't use weeks)
- ‚úÖ Updated fetch function to call NHL backend

### 5. NHL-Specific Terminology
Bulk replacements using PowerShell:
- ‚úÖ `quarter` ‚Üí `period` (NHL has 3 periods, not 4 quarters)
- ‚úÖ `Quarter` ‚Üí `Period`
- ‚úÖ `Down` ‚Üí `Shots` (NHL tracks shots on goal)
- ‚úÖ `down` ‚Üí `shots`

### 6. **CRITICAL FIX: Game Status Bug**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed isLive calculation** (same bug as MLB had)
- ‚ùå OLD (buggy):
  ```javascript
  const isLive = statusType === 'in' || comp.status.period > 0;
  ```
- ‚úÖ NEW (correct):
  ```javascript
  const isLive = statusType === 'in';
  ```
- **Why**: NHL games can have `period: 1` even when scheduled (`state: 'pre'`), just like MLB. Using `period > 0` would incorrectly mark scheduled games as LIVE.
- **Fixed in TWO locations**:
  1. Game filtering logic (~line 1980)
  2. Game card rendering logic (~line 2090)

### 7. File Operations
- ‚úÖ Moved `nhl.html` ‚Üí `nhl-old.html` (backup old version)
- ‚úÖ Moved `nhl-new.html` ‚Üí `nhl.html` (activate new version)
