## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No logs appearing in console"
**Cause**: Not in Sports Bar Mode or no games added
**Solution**: 
1. Click "Enter Sports Bar Mode"
2. Add at least one game to the grid
3. Check console again

### Issue 2: "Score check logs show but no animation"
**Possible Causes**:
- `awayScoreChange: 0` and `homeScoreChange: 0` (no score change)
- Animation CSS not loaded properly
- Card element not found

**Solution**:
1. Check if `awayScoreChange` or `homeScoreChange` > 0
2. Use the Test Animation button to verify CSS is working
3. Refresh the page

### Issue 3: "cardExists: false in logs"
**Cause**: Card was not found in DOM
**Solution**: 
1. Verify games are rendered in fullscreen grid
2. Check if `renderFullscreenGames()` completed
3. Refresh and try again

### Issue 4: "Animation appears but disappears immediately"
**Cause**: Card is being re-rendered too quickly
**Solution**: This has been fixed - animations now run AFTER rendering

### Issue 5: "Test button doesn't work"
**Possible Causes**:
- Not in Sports Bar Mode (fullscreen)
- No games added to grid
- Button not visible

**Solution**:
1. Enter Sports Bar Mode (fullscreen)
