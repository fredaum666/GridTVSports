### Server Changes (server.js)
- ‚úÖ Added `finalGamesStore` in-memory storage for all sports
- ‚úÖ Created `POST /api/final-games/save` endpoint to save final games
- ‚úÖ Created `GET /api/final-games/:sport` endpoint to retrieve final games

- ‚úÖ Final games older than 2 hours are hidden from game selection dropdown

### NFL Page (nfl.html)

- ‚úÖ Removed all modal functions (showGameDetail, loadBoxScore, loadGameStats, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Removed click event listeners from game cards
- ‚úÖ Added Final Games HTML section
- ‚úÖ Created `renderFinalGames()` function to fetch and display final games
- ‚úÖ Modified `fetchLiveGames()` to auto-save games when they finish
- ‚úÖ Calls `renderFinalGames()` on each refresh

## üìã Remaining Work

### Apply Same Changes to Other Sports

You need to repeat the NFL changes for NBA, MLB, and NHL pages:

#### For Each Sport File (nba.html, mlb.html, nhl.html):

1. **Remove Modal** (same as NFL)
   - Delete `<div class="modal-overlay" id="game-detail-modal">...</div>`
   - Remove click event listener: `card.addEventListener('click', () => showGameDetail(...));`
   - Delete all modal-related functions

2. **Add Final Games Section** (same structure)
   ```html
   <div id="final-games-section" style="margin-top: 60px; display: none;">
     <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700; color: #f3f4f6;">
       üèÅ Final Games
     </h2>
     <div class="games-grid" id="final-games-list"></div>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Add renderFinalGames() Function**
   - Copy from NFL but change sport name in API call
   - Example: `await fetch('/api/final-games/nba')`

4. **Modify Game Fetching Logic**
   - Add final game detection and save logic
   - Call `renderFinalGames()` after rendering live games

5. **Week/Date Cleanup** (Optional)
   - NFL uses weeks
   - NBA/MLB/NHL use dates
   - Add logic to clear old final games when date/week advances

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Server starts without errors
- [x] Mixed Sports Bar Mode filters final games after 2 hours
- [x] NFL page shows final games in separate section
- [x] NFL page saves games to database when they finish
- [ ] NBA page implemented
- [ ] MLB page implemented
- [ ] NHL page implemented
- [ ] Final games clear when week/date advances
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## API Endpoints Summary

### Save Final Game
```bash
POST /api/final-games/save
Body: {
  "sport": "nfl|nba|mlb|nhl",
  "gameId": "game-id",
  "gameData": { ... },
  "week": 1 (optional, for NFL)
}
```

### Get Final Games
```bash
GET /api/final-games/:sport
Response: { "games": [...], "count": 5 }
```

### Clear Final Games
```bash
DELETE /api/final-games/clear/:sport?week=18
```

## Notes

- Final games are stored in-memory and will be lost on server restart
- For production, migrate to PostgreSQL database
- The 2-hour window uses the game's `date` field as the reference point
- Games are automatically saved when status changes from 'in' to 'post'

## Next Steps

1. Apply the same changes to NBA, MLB, and NHL pages
2. Test all sport pages thoroughly
3. Consider adding persistent database storage (PostgreSQL)
4. Add automatic cleanup logic for old final games
5. Test mobile responsiveness across all pages
