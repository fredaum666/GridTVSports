# Final Step: Generate App Password

Great! You found the right setting.

**Yes, select "Disabled" and Save.** 
Microsoft shows that warning because this action enables older protocols (which is exactly what we need for the app to send emails) and allows App Passwords.

## Next Steps

Once you have saved that change:

1.  **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the setting to update across Microsoft's system.
2.  Go to **[Microsoft 365 My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/)**.
3.  Click on **Security info** (in the Security tile).
4.  Click **+ Add sign-in method**.
5.  Select **App password** from the list.
    *   *(If "App password" is still not missing, refresh the page or wait a few more minutes).*
6.  Name it `GridTV Credentials`.
7.  **Copy the password** it shows you.
8.  Paste it into the chat, and I will update your `.env` file.
