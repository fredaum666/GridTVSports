# 🎯 Game Card Hover Animation Removed

## ✅ Change Completed

**File Modified**: `/public/styles/responsive-cards.css`

**What Was Changed**: Removed the zoom/lift animation (`transform: translateY(-4px)`) from game cards on hover.

---

## 📋 Before & After

### Before (With Animation)
```css
.game-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);  /* Card lifts up 4px */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  border-color: #3b82f6;
}
```

**Effect**: When hovering over a game card, it would lift up by 4 pixels, creating a "pop out" effect.

### After (No Animation)
```css
.game-card:hover {
  /* Zoom animation removed - keeping subtle highlight only */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  border-color: #3b82f6;
}
```

**Effect**: When hovering over a game card, only the border color changes to blue and the shadow becomes more prominent. No movement.

## 🎨 What Still Happens on Hover

Cards still have **subtle visual feedback** when hovered:

1. ✅ **Border color** changes to blue (#3b82f6)
2. ✅ **Shadow** becomes more prominent (enhanced depth)
3. ❌ **No zoom/lift animation** (removed)

This provides visual feedback that the card is interactive without the motion effect.

## 📱 Applies To All Pages

This change affects **all league pages**:
- ✅ LiveGames.html (Mixed Sports)
- ✅ nfl.html
- ✅ nba.html
- ✅ mlb.html
- ✅ nhl.html

All pages use the same `responsive-cards.css` file, so the change applies everywhere automatically.

## 📝 Technical Details

### CSS Change Location
- **File**: `public/styles/responsive-cards.css`
- **Line**: 44-48
- **Change**: Removed `transform: translateY(-4px);`

### Why This Works
The `transform: translateY()` CSS property was causing the card to move vertically on hover. By removing it, the card stays in place while still showing visual feedback through border and shadow changes.

### Other Hover Effects Preserved
- **Buttons** still have a subtle 2px lift (standard UI pattern)
- **Fullscreen cards** have no hover animations (intentional)
- **Empty state cards** have no hover effects

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Reduced motion** - Better for users sensitive to animations
2. **Cleaner look** - Less visual distraction
3. **Performance** - Slightly better rendering performance
4. **Accessibility** - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` better

## 🔄 Reverting (If Needed)

To restore the animation, change line 45 in `responsive-cards.css` to:

```css
.game-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);  /* Re-add this line */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  border-color: #3b82f6;
}
```
